# ArduinoSerial

This is an application for communicating with an Arduino over serial much like the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE. However the serial Monitor only supports sending ascii characters. 

For example There is no practical way to send a byte value of 0xC. ArduinoSerial allows you to specify whether the string you want to send the literal string, interpret it as a decimal number or a hex value.
